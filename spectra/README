Files like
z517.spec.tex

File name here gives the emission redshift of the quasar, e.g., z_em=5.17
in the above example.
First column is log10(wavelength), second column is Flux in some units.

Corresponding files named
z517.var.tex give the noise array:
First column is log10(wavelength), second column is inverse variance, in
same units as "spec.tex" file.

Files like
z582_hres.spec.tex
z582_hres.var.tex

are similar, except first column is wavelength (angstroms), rather than
log10(wavelength). Second column is flux, but in different units than above.
Here the ".var.tex" files give the noise sigma, rather than the inverse variance.

Files like Q0836-spec.tex have columns
with wavelength in angstroms, and flux.
Those with names like Q0836-noise.tex are the corresponding error arrays.
Here the columns in the error array files are wavelength and sigma_flux.

The following table gives the emission redshift of the quasars in this case
(from Fan, Strauss, et al. 0512082):

Q0836+0054 z_em=5.82
Q1306+0356 z_em=5.99

Finally, the files "qso_z_628_lo_res.txt" and "qso_z_637_lo_res.txt"
have columns with log10(wavelength) and flux, with z_em=6.28, 6.37 respectively.
The corresponding noise arrays are in "noise_z_xxx_lo_res.txt', and
have log10(wavelength), sigma_flux columns.

File LBQS.lis is the LBQS quasar composite, which can be used to set the unabsorbed quasar 
continuum. The first column is rest frame wavelength. The second column is flux in some units.
