Files like
z517.spec.tex

File name here gives the redshift of the quasar.
First column is log10(wavelength), second column is Flux in some units.

Corresponding files named
z517.var.tex give the noise array:
First column is log10(wavelength), second column is inverse variance, in
same units as "spec.tex" file.

Files like
z582_hres.spec.tex
z582_hres.var.tex

are similar, except first column is wavelength (angstroms), rather than
log10(wavelength). Second column is flux, but in different units.
Here the ".var.tex" files give the noise sigma, rather than the inverse variance.

File LBQS.lis is the LBQS quasar composite, which can be used to set the continuum.
The first column is rest frame wavelength. The second column is flux in some units.

Files like J0836+0054.spec have columns
with wavelength in angstroms, and flux.
Those with names like J0836+0053.sig are the corresponding error arrays.
Here the columns in the error array files are wavelength and sigma_flux.

The following table gives the redshift of the quasars in this case
(from Fan, Strauss, et al. 0512082)
J0002+2550 z_em=5.80
J0836+0054 z_em=5.82
J1044-0125 z_em=5.74
J1306+0356 z_em=5.99
J1602+4228 z_em=6.07
J1630+4012 z_em=6.05
